# Overview
I wrote a weather forecast web page that allows the user to input their location and get the weather for 7 days in that location.

My purpose for writing this software was to learn the JavaScript language and how API's work.

I used Visual Studio Code with the NeoVim extension.

I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the day.js library.
